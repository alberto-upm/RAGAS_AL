In this case, the prompt again includes a definition of the considered quality metric. For instance, for evaluating answer relevance, we used the following prompt: Answer Relevancy measures the degree to which a response directly addresses and is appropriate for a given question. It penalizes the present of redundant in- formation or incomplete answers given a question. Given an question and answer, rank each answer based on Answer Rele- vancy. question: [question] answer 1: [answer 1] answer 2: [answer 2] The results in Table 1 show that our proposed metrics are much closer aligned with the human judgements than the predictions from the two base- lines. For faithfulness, the RAGAs prediction are in general highly accurate. For answer relevance, the agreement is lower, but this is largely due to the fact that the differences between the two candidate answers are often very subtle. We found context relevance to be the hardest quality dimension to evaluate. In particular, we observed that ChatGPT often struggles with the task of selecting the sen- tences from the context that are crucial, especially for longer contexts. 6 Conclusions We have highlighted the need for automated reference-free evaluation of RAG systems. In par- ticular, we have argued the need for an evaluation framework that can assess faithfulness (i.e. is the answer grounded in the retrieved context), answer relevance (i.e. does the answer address the ques- tion) and context relevance (i.e. is the retrieved context sufficiently focused). To support the devel- opment of such a framework, we have introduced WikiEval, a dataset which human judgements of these three different aspects. Finally, we have also described RAGAs, our implementation of the three considered quality aspects. This framework is easy to use and can provide deverlopers of RAG sys- tems with valuable insights, even in the absence of any ground truth. Our evaluation on WikiEval has shown that the predictions from RAGAs are closely aligned with human predictions, especially for faithfulness and answer relevance. References Amos Azaria and Tom M.

The answer relevance score, AR, for question q is then computed as: AR = 1 n n (cid:88) i=1 sim(q, qi) This metric evaluates how closely the generated answer aligns with the initial question or instruc- tion. Context relevance The context c(q) is consid- ered relevant to the extent that it exclusively con- tains information that is needed to answer the ques- tion. In particular, this metric aims to penalise the (1) inclusion of redundant information. To estimate context relevance, given a question q and its con- text c(q), the LLM extracts a subset of sentences, Sext, from c(q) that are crucial to answer q, using the following prompt: Please extract relevant sentences from the provided context that can potentially help answer the following question. If no relevant sentences are found, or if you believe the question cannot be answered from the given context, return the phrase \\\"Insufficient Information\\\". While extract- ing candidate sentences you’re not al- lowed to make any changes to sentences from given context. The context relevance score is then computed as: CR = number of extracted sentences total number of sentences in c(q) 4 The WikiEval Dataset To evaluate the proposed framework, we ideally need examples of question-context-answer triples which are annotated with human judgments. We can then verify to what extent our metrics agree with human assessments of faithfulness, answer relevance and context relevance. Since we are not aware of any publicly available datasets that could be used for this purpose, we created a new dataset, which we refer to as WikiEval4. To construct the dataset, we first selected 50 Wikipedia pages cov- ering events that have happened since the start of 20225. In selecting these pages, we prioritised those with recent edits. For each of the 50 pages, we then asked ChatGPT to suggest a question that can be answered based on the introductory section of the page, using the following prompt: Your task is to formulate a question from given context satisfying the rules given below: 1. The question should be fully answered from the given context. 2. The question should be framed from a part that contains non-trivial informa- tion. 3. The answer should not contain any 4https://huggingface.co/datasets/ explodinggradients/WikiEval 5That is, beyond the reported training cutoff of the model we used in our experiments. (2) links. 4. The question should be of moderate difficulty. 5. The question must be reasonable and must be understood and responded to by humans. 6. Do not use phrases that ’provided con- text’, etc in the question context: We also used ChatGPT to answer the generated question, when given the corresponding introduc- tory section as context, using the following prompt: Answer the question using the informa- tion from the given context. question: [question] context: [context] All questions were annotated along the three con- sidered quality dimensions by two annotators. Both annotators were fluent in English and were given clear instructions about the meaning of the three considered quality dimensions. For faithfulness and context relevance, the two annotators agreed in around 95% of cases. For answer relevance, they agreed in around 90% of the cases. Disagreements were resolved after a discussion between the anno- tators. Faithfulness To obtain human judgements about faithfulness, we first used ChatGPT to answer the question without access to any additional context. We then asked the annotators to judge which of the two answers was the most faithful (i.e. the standard one or the one generated without context), given the question and corresponding Wikipedia page. Answer relevance We first used ChatGPT to obtain candidate answers with lower answer rel- evance, using the following prompt: Answer the given question in an incom- plete manner. question: [question] We then asked human annotators to compare this answer, and indicate which of the two answers had the highest answer relevance. Context relevance To measure this aspect, we first added additional sentences to the context by scraping back-links to the corresponding Wikipedia page. In this way, we were able to add information to the context that was related but less relevant for Faith. Ans. Rel. Cont. Rel.

For the few pages with- out any back-links, we instead used ChatGPT to complete the given context. 5 Experiments Table 1 analyses the agreement between the met- rics proposed in Section 3 and the human assess- ments from the proposed WikiEval dataset. Each WikiEval instance requires the model to compare two answers or two context fragments. We count how often the answer/context preferred by the model (i.e. with highest estimated faithfulness, an- swer relevance, or context relevance) coincides with the answer/context preferred by the human annotators. We report the results in terms of ac- curacy (i.e. the fraction of instances on which the model agrees with the annotators). To put the results in context, we compare our proposed metrics (shown as RAGAs in Table 1) with two baseline methods. For the first method, shown as GPT Score, we ask ChatGPT to assign a score between 0 and 10 for the three quality dimensions. To this end, we use a prompt that describes the meaning of the quality metric and then asks to score the given answer/context in line with that definition. For instance, for evaluating faithfulness, we used the following prompt: Faithfulness measures the information consistency of the answer against the given context. Any claims that are made in the answer that cannot be deduced from context should be penalized. Given an answer and context, assign a score for faithfulness in the range 0-10. context: [context] answer: [answer] Ties, where the same score is assigned by the LLM to both answer candidates, were broken randomly.

They are crucial in linguistics for analyzing acoustic properties of speech and offer detailed insights into temporal and spectral characteristics, allowing researchers to study articulatory gestures and acoustic cues. In phonetics, spectrograms are instrumental in studying speech and its pro- duction [4]. They provide a tool to analyze the fine-grained details of articulatory movements, such as formant patterns and consonant releases [28]. Spectrograms allow linguists to investigate phonetic features like voicing, place and manner of articulation, and vowel quality, helping in the characterization and classification of speech sounds across languages [6,29]. There are even spectrogram reading competitions in conferences such as International Phonetics Association Confer- ence and Australasian Speech Science and Technology Association Conference. In phonology, spectrograms aid in understanding phonological processes and patterns [13]. They facilitate the identification of phonemic contrasts, allophonic variations, and sociolinguistic phenomena such as regional accents and dialectal variations [8]. Spectrograms also aid in the study of language variation, speech disorders, language acquisition, and cross-linguistic differences in phonetic pat- terns. While spectrograms have limitations in capturing prosody, intonation, and 3 4 Jesin James et al. discourse structure, they remain highly significant in linguistics as a powerful tool for analyzing speech sounds. Voiced and Unvoiced Speech Voiced speech is produced when the vocal folds vibrate, resulting in a periodic airflow. They include sounds such as vowels and voiced consonants. In spectrograms, voiced sounds exhibit a characteristic pattern as seen in Fig. 1(a) to (e). They display regular bands of energy, known as formants, which represent the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. Voiced speech has a harmonic structure and exhibit sustained energy throughout their duration. Unvoiced sounds are produced without vocal fold vibration. They include voiceless consonants. The spectrograms of unvoiced sounds lack a clear har- monic structure and exhibit a more random and dispersed distribution of energy across a wide range of frequencies, as seen in Fig. 1(f). Unvoiced sounds are characterized by transient bursts of energy concentrated around the onset and release of the sound [20]. Vowel Sounds The combination of formant information and supplementary spectral features in spectrograms enables linguists to distinguish and analyze vowel sounds in their linguistic investigations. Formants correspond to the res- onant frequencies of the vocal tract during vowel production. By observing the positioning, spacing, and relative intensity of these formants in the spectrogram, linguists can identify and categorize different vowel sounds. For example, in Fig. 1 (a) to (e), the vowels have distinct formant patterns. The first formant of /i/ is 385 Hz, /u/ is 400 Hz, /æ/ is 800 Hz, /Ç/ in 590 Hz and /A/ is 710 Hz (formant estimation was done by observing the spectrograms and verified using Praat [2]). These values are within the frequency range expected for American English [17]. Differences exist for the second, third and fourth formants too, as seen by the formant bands at different frequencies in the Fig.. Spectrograms offer insights into acoustic cues related to vowel articulation, including vowel duration and spectral shape. The shape of the spectral pattern in a vowel is influenced by the tongue position and the openness of the oral cavity, which determine the shape and configuration of the vocal tract. High vowels like /i/ and /u/ typically exhibit a more concentrated spectral shape with higher energy in the higher frequency range (See 1 (a) and (e)). This results from the tongue being positioned closer to the roof of the mouth, giving rise to a narrower constriction in the vocal tract and emphasizing higher-frequency resonances. The distinction in vowel duration can be observed using the spectrogram’s horizontal axis. E.g., comparing the horizontal axis of Fig. 1 (a) and (c), we can observe /i/ is a longer vowel than /Ç/.\\\"\\n}\\nOutput: \"\n}\nOutput: ", "response": "generations=[[ChatGeneration(text='{\\n    \"query\": \"In the context of speech classification models used by AI Researchers, what is the function of the softmax activation function in the ResNet-101 model?\",\\n    \"answer\": \"In the provided context, the softmax activation function is used in the ResNet-101 model to make the final decision during the training process of speech classification models.

They are crucial in linguistics for analyzing acoustic properties of speech and offer detailed insights into temporal and spectral characteristics, allowing researchers to study articulatory gestures and acoustic cues. In phonetics, spectrograms are instrumental in studying speech and its pro- duction [4]. They provide a tool to analyze the fine-grained details of articulatory movements, such as formant patterns and consonant releases [28]. Spectrograms allow linguists to investigate phonetic features like voicing, place and manner of articulation, and vowel quality, helping in the characterization and classification of speech sounds across languages [6,29]. There are even spectrogram reading competitions in conferences such as International Phonetics Association Confer- ence and Australasian Speech Science and Technology Association Conference. In phonology, spectrograms aid in understanding phonological processes and patterns [13]. They facilitate the identification of phonemic contrasts, allophonic variations, and sociolinguistic phenomena such as regional accents and dialectal variations [8]. Spectrograms also aid in the study of language variation, speech disorders, language acquisition, and cross-linguistic differences in phonetic pat- terns. While spectrograms have limitations in capturing prosody, intonation, and 3 4 Jesin James et al. discourse structure, they remain highly significant in linguistics as a powerful tool for analyzing speech sounds. Voiced and Unvoiced Speech Voiced speech is produced when the vocal folds vibrate, resulting in a periodic airflow. They include sounds such as vowels and voiced consonants. In spectrograms, voiced sounds exhibit a characteristic pattern as seen in Fig. 1(a) to (e). They display regular bands of energy, known as formants, which represent the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. Voiced speech has a harmonic structure and exhibit sustained energy throughout their duration. Unvoiced sounds are produced without vocal fold vibration. They include voiceless consonants. The spectrograms of unvoiced sounds lack a clear har- monic structure and exhibit a more random and dispersed distribution of energy across a wide range of frequencies, as seen in Fig. 1(f). Unvoiced sounds are characterized by transient bursts of energy concentrated around the onset and release of the sound [20]. Vowel Sounds The combination of formant information and supplementary spectral features in spectrograms enables linguists to distinguish and analyze vowel sounds in their linguistic investigations. Formants correspond to the res- onant frequencies of the vocal tract during vowel production. By observing the positioning, spacing, and relative intensity of these formants in the spectrogram, linguists can identify and categorize different vowel sounds. For example, in Fig. 1 (a) to (e), the vowels have distinct formant patterns. The first formant of /i/ is 385 Hz, /u/ is 400 Hz, /æ/ is 800 Hz, /Ç/ in 590 Hz and /A/ is 710 Hz (formant estimation was done by observing the spectrograms and verified using Praat [2]). These values are within the frequency range expected for American English [17]. Differences exist for the second, third and fourth formants too, as seen by the formant bands at different frequencies in the Fig.. Spectrograms offer insights into acoustic cues related to vowel articulation, including vowel duration and spectral shape. The shape of the spectral pattern in a vowel is influenced by the tongue position and the openness of the oral cavity, which determine the shape and configuration of the vocal tract. High vowels like /i/ and /u/ typically exhibit a more concentrated spectral shape with higher energy in the higher frequency range (See 1 (a) and (e)). This results from the tongue being positioned closer to the roof of the mouth, giving rise to a narrower constriction in the vocal tract and emphasizing higher-frequency resonances. The distinction in vowel duration can be observed using the spectrogram’s horizontal axis. E.g., comparing the horizontal axis of Fig. 1 (a) and (c), we can observe /i/ is a longer vowel than /Ç/.\\\"\\n}\\nOutput: \"\n}\nOutput: ", "response": "generations=[[ChatGeneration(text='{\\n    \"query\": \"Can you explain how frequency content is represented in spectrograms, a topic related to AI research?\",\\n    \"answer\": \"In the context provided, frequency content is represented in spectrograms as a visualization of the frequency content of a speech signal over time.

Context relevance The context c(q) is consid- ered relevant to the extent that it exclusively con- tains information that is needed to answer the ques- tion. In particular, this metric aims to penalise the (1) inclusion of redundant information. To estimate context relevance, given a question q and its con- text c(q), the LLM extracts a subset of sentences, Sext, from c(q) that are crucial to answer q, using the following prompt: Please extract relevant sentences from the provided context that can potentially help answer the following question. If no relevant sentences are found, or if you believe the question cannot be answered from the given context, return the phrase \\\"Insufficient Information\\\". While extract- ing candidate sentences you’re not al- lowed to make any changes to sentences from given context. The context relevance score is then computed as: CR = number of extracted sentences total number of sentences in c(q) 4 The WikiEval Dataset To evaluate the proposed framework, we ideally need examples of question-context-answer triples which are annotated with human judgments. We can then verify to what extent our metrics agree with human assessments of faithfulness, answer relevance and context relevance. Since we are not aware of any publicly available datasets that could be used for this purpose, we created a new dataset, which we refer to as WikiEval4. To construct the dataset, we first selected 50 Wikipedia pages cov- ering events that have happened since the start of 20225. In selecting these pages, we prioritised those with recent edits. For each of the 50 pages, we then asked ChatGPT to suggest a question that can be answered based on the introductory section of the page, using the following prompt: Your task is to formulate a question from given context satisfying the rules given below: 1. The question should be fully answered from the given context. 2. The question should be framed from a part that contains non-trivial informa- tion. 3. The answer should not contain any 4https://huggingface.co/datasets/ explodinggradients/WikiEval 5That is, beyond the reported training cutoff of the model we used in our experiments. (2) links. 4. The question should be of moderate difficulty. 5. The question must be reasonable and must be understood and responded to by humans. 6. Do not use phrases that ’provided con- text’, etc in the question context: We also used ChatGPT to answer the generated question, when given the corresponding introduc- tory section as context, using the following prompt: Answer the question using the informa- tion from the given context. question: [question] context: [context] All questions were annotated along the three con- sidered quality dimensions by two annotators. Both annotators were fluent in English and were given clear instructions about the meaning of the three considered quality dimensions. For faithfulness and context relevance, the two annotators agreed in around 95% of cases. For answer relevance, they agreed in around 90% of the cases. Disagreements were resolved after a discussion between the anno- tators. Faithfulness To obtain human judgements about faithfulness, we first used ChatGPT to answer the question without access to any additional context. We then asked the annotators to judge which of the two answers was the most faithful (i.e. the standard one or the one generated without context), given the question and corresponding Wikipedia page. Answer relevance We first used ChatGPT to obtain candidate answers with lower answer rel- evance, using the following prompt: Answer the given question in an incom- plete manner. question: [question] We then asked human annotators to compare this answer, and indicate which of the two answers had the highest answer relevance. Context relevance To measure this aspect, we first added additional sentences to the context by scraping back-links to the corresponding Wikipedia page. In this way, we were able to add information to the context that was related but less relevant for Faith. Ans. Rel. Cont. Rel.

For the few pages with- out any back-links, we instead used ChatGPT to complete the given context. 5 Experiments Table 1 analyses the agreement between the met- rics proposed in Section 3 and the human assess- ments from the proposed WikiEval dataset. Each WikiEval instance requires the model to compare two answers or two context fragments. We count how often the answer/context preferred by the model (i.e. with highest estimated faithfulness, an- swer relevance, or context relevance) coincides with the answer/context preferred by the human annotators. We report the results in terms of ac- curacy (i.e. the fraction of instances on which the model agrees with the annotators). To put the results in context, we compare our proposed metrics (shown as RAGAs in Table 1) with two baseline methods. For the first method, shown as GPT Score, we ask ChatGPT to assign a score between 0 and 10 for the three quality dimensions. To this end, we use a prompt that describes the meaning of the quality metric and then asks to score the given answer/context in line with that definition. For instance, for evaluating faithfulness, we used the following prompt: Faithfulness measures the information consistency of the answer against the given context. Any claims that are made in the answer that cannot be deduced from context should be penalized. Given an answer and context, assign a score for faithfulness in the range 0-10. context: [context] answer: [answer] Ties, where the same score is assigned by the LLM to both answer candidates, were broken randomly. The second baseline, shown as GPT Ranking, in- stead asks\",\n        \"<2-hop>\\n\\nConsidering the limitations of using a fixed set of stereotypes and the fact that likelihoods do not always correspond to model outputs (Parrish et al., 2022), in Section 6, we take a lexicon-free ap- proach that utilizes the given names in our dataset in a generation task. An example output can be seen in Table 1. We present both quantitative and qual- itative analyses of representational harms caused by stereotypical outputs. The results highlight the magnitude of stereotypical bias across both open and closed-sourced LLMs. From this, this work presents the following contributions: 1. the GlobalBias1 dataset for studying harm- ful stereotypes, which consists of 876,000 sentences for 40 distinct gender-by-ethnicity groups 2. an analysis of which stereotypes are surfaced for each group by a number of LMs, and the extent and nature of harm caused by the these stereotypes, particularly for intersec- tional groups 3. the finding that larger models have more stereotypical outputs, even when explicitly in- structed to avoid stereotypes and clichés 4. the finding that bias stays consistent across model’s internal representation and outputs, contrary to claims in previous work in the field. 2 Background and Related Work 2.1 Impact of Stereotyping Stereotyping can influence how we perceive our- selves and others, as well as how we behave to- wards others. For example, Bertrand and Mul- lainathan (2004) found résumés with White names received 50% more invitations to interview than resumes with Black names. More broadly, Bier- nat (2003) found that when one judges individual members of stereotyped groups on stereotyped di- mensions, one does so with reference to within- category standards, e.g. evaluations of men and women on leadership competence may not be di- rectly comparable, as their meaning is tied to differ- ent referents: ‘good’ for a woman does not mean 1The dataset and code used to evaluate the mod- els can be found at https://github.com/groovychoons/ GlobalBias. the same thing as ‘good’ for a man. LLMs trained on data that includes stereotypes or LLMs using non-comprehensive systems to mitigate biases can perpetuate discrimination and social inequality in ways that are difficult to detect and address. 2.2 Axes of Analysis Early work on bias in word embeddings focused on a single dimension, predominantly binary gen- der (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018b; Ethayarajh et al., 2019), and less frequently, race (Caliskan et al., 2017; Garg et al., 2018). Work looking at a single demographic axis often fails to mirror the reality of race and gender being inter- twined. Crenshaw (1989) defines how using a single-axis framework erases Black women’s experience in le- gal and political contexts, as race discrimination tends to be viewed in terms of gender-privileged Blacks, and gender discrimination focuses on race- privileged women. Crenshaw provides a frame- work for understanding how different aspects of a person’s social and political identities combine to create different modes of discrimination and privi- lege, known as intersectionality. There is a growing body of research in the field of intersectional bias, which starts to investigate the nuance of how race and gender interact (Jiang and Fellbaum, 2020). There are several measures defined for evaluating intersectional biases, such as the angry black woman stereotype in contextual word embeddings (May et al., 2019; Tan and Celis, 2019), the contextual word embedding test (CEAT) which also looks at a limited and fixed labelled set of stereotypes (Guo and Caliskan, 2020), and others (Lepori, 2020; Cao et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2023). 2.3 Stereotype Datasets This paper builds on previous work using stereo- types as a means of exploring characteristics that are observed to be associated with specific demo- graphic groups, reinforcing established social hi- erarchies (Greenwald et al., 1998; Blodgett et al., 2021). A number of datasets have been developed to look specifically at stereotypes, largely focus- ing on using sentence pairs to compare two de- mographic groups (May et al., 2019), a stereotype and anti-stereotype (Zhao et al., 2018a; Nangia et al., 2020; Nadeem et al., 2021), or a question and answer set to compare two groups (Parrish et al., 2022). While valuable, these datasets are all situ- ated within a U.S. context (Blodgett et al., 2021), and are unsuitable for our context of analysing mul- tiple subgroups across a single stereotype. In con- trast, our one-vs-all approach offers more robust statistical power, and reduces the impact of outliers and natural variability in two-group comparisons. In terms of metrics, we posit that perplexity, which Smith et al. (2022) and Smith and Williams (2021) used to compare multiple subgroups in one test, is a suitable method, and thus we develop it further. 2.4 Use of Proper Names There exists measurable statistical tendencies for names to refer to both gender and race demo- graphics (Tzioumis, 2018). May et al. (2019) ob- serves that \\\"tests based on given names more of- ten find a significant association than those based on group terms\\\". Therefore, we use given names as a proxy for ethnicity and gender, based on ev- idence that given names are often used to draw stereotypical conclusions about people by both hu- mans (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003; Dechief and Oreopoulos, 2012) and in LLM outputs (De- Arteaga et al., 2019; Romanov et al., 2019; Maud- slay et al., 2019). Using a range of names for each group intends to mitigate the impact of any single name on the group’s overall results. 3 The Dataset We propose a new dataset named GlobalBias for studying harmful stereotypes, which consists of sets of 10 proper names spanning 40 groups. A summary of key data can be found in Table 2. 3.1 Proper Names Our primary objective is to compile a list of di- verse demographic groups, alongside representa- tive names for each group. In this section, we discuss how we build such a dataset, of specifically 40 distinct groups, starting from existing labeled resources. Our seed dataset of names is the Genni + Eth- nea dataset (Torvik, 2018).

The answer relevance score, AR, for question q is then computed as: AR = 1 n n (cid:88) i=1 sim(q, qi) This metric evaluates how closely the generated answer aligns with the initial question or instruc- tion. Context relevance The context c(q) is consid- ered relevant to the extent that it exclusively con- tains information that is needed to answer the ques- tion. In particular, this metric aims to penalise the (1) inclusion of redundant information. To estimate context relevance, given a question q and its con- text c(q), the LLM extracts a subset of sentences, Sext, from c(q) that are crucial to answer q, using the following prompt: Please extract relevant sentences from the provided context that can potentially help answer the following question. If no relevant sentences are found, or if you believe the question cannot be answered from the given context, return the phrase \\\"Insufficient Information\\\". While extract- ing candidate sentences you’re not al- lowed to make any changes to sentences from given context. The context relevance score is then computed as: CR = number of extracted sentences total number of sentences in c(q) 4 The WikiEval Dataset To evaluate the proposed framework, we ideally need examples of question-context-answer triples which are annotated with human judgments. We can then verify to what extent our metrics agree with human assessments of faithfulness, answer relevance and context relevance. Since we are not aware of any publicly available datasets that could be used for this purpose, we created a new dataset, which we refer to as WikiEval4. To construct the dataset, we first selected 50 Wikipedia pages cov- ering events that have happened since the start of 20225. In selecting these pages, we prioritised those with recent edits. For each of the 50 pages, we then asked ChatGPT to suggest a question that can be answered based on the introductory section of the page, using the following prompt: Your task is to formulate a question from given context satisfying the rules given below: 1. The question should be fully answered from the given context. 2. The question should be framed from a part that contains non-trivial informa- tion. 3. The answer should not contain any 4https://huggingface.co/datasets/ explodinggradients/WikiEval 5That is, beyond the reported training cutoff of the model we used in our experiments. (2) links. 4. The question should be of moderate difficulty. 5. The question must be reasonable and must be understood and responded to by humans. 6. Do not use phrases that ’provided con- text’, etc in the question context: We also used ChatGPT to answer the generated question, when given the corresponding introduc- tory section as context, using the following prompt: Answer the question using the informa- tion from the given context. question: [question] context: [context] All questions were annotated along the three con- sidered quality dimensions by two annotators. Both annotators were fluent in English and were given clear instructions about the meaning of the three considered quality dimensions. For faithfulness and context relevance, the two annotators agreed in around 95% of cases. For answer relevance, they agreed in around 90% of the cases. Disagreements were resolved after a discussion between the anno- tators. Faithfulness To obtain human judgements about faithfulness, we first used ChatGPT to answer the question without access to any additional context. We then asked the annotators to judge which of the two answers was the most faithful (i.e. the standard one or the one generated without context), given the question and corresponding Wikipedia page. Answer relevance We first used ChatGPT to obtain candidate answers with lower answer rel- evance, using the following prompt: Answer the given question in an incom- plete manner. question: [question] We then asked human annotators to compare this answer, and indicate which of the two answers had the highest answer relevance. Context relevance To measure this aspect, we first added additional sentences to the context by scraping back-links to the corresponding Wikipedia page. In this way, we were able to add information to the context that was related but less relevant for Faith. Ans. Rel. Cont. Rel.

For the few pages with- out any back-links, we instead used ChatGPT to complete the given context. 5 Experiments Table 1 analyses the agreement between the met- rics proposed in Section 3 and the human assess- ments from the proposed WikiEval dataset. Each WikiEval instance requires the model to compare two answers or two context fragments. We count how often the answer/context preferred by the model (i.e. with highest estimated faithfulness, an- swer relevance, or context relevance) coincides with the answer/context preferred by the human annotators. We report the results in terms of ac- curacy (i.e. the fraction of instances on which the model agrees with the annotators). To put the results in context, we compare our proposed metrics (shown as RAGAs in Table 1) with two baseline methods. For the first method, shown as GPT Score, we ask ChatGPT to assign a score between 0 and 10 for the three quality dimensions. To this end, we use a prompt that describes the meaning of the quality metric and then asks to score the given answer/context in line with that definition. For instance, for evaluating faithfulness, we used the following prompt: Faithfulness measures the information consistency of the answer against the given context. Any claims that are made in the answer that cannot be deduced from context should be penalized. Given an answer and context, assign a score for faithfulness in the range 0-10. context: [context] answer: [answer] Ties, where the same score is assigned by the LLM to both answer candidates, were broken randomly. The second baseline, shown as GPT Ranking, in- stead asks\",\n        \"<2-hop>\\n\\nConsidering the limitations of using a fixed set of stereotypes and the fact that likelihoods do not always correspond to model outputs (Parrish et al., 2022), in Section 6, we take a lexicon-free ap- proach that utilizes the given names in our dataset in a generation task. An example output can be seen in Table 1. We present both quantitative and qual- itative analyses of representational harms caused by stereotypical outputs. The results highlight the magnitude of stereotypical bias across both open and closed-sourced LLMs. From this, this work presents the following contributions: 1. the GlobalBias1 dataset for studying harm- ful stereotypes, which consists of 876,000 sentences for 40 distinct gender-by-ethnicity groups 2. an analysis of which stereotypes are surfaced for each group by a number of LMs, and the extent and nature of harm caused by the these stereotypes, particularly for intersec- tional groups 3. the finding that larger models have more stereotypical outputs, even when explicitly in- structed to avoid stereotypes and clichés 4. the finding that bias stays consistent across model’s internal representation and outputs, contrary to claims in previous work in the field. 2 Background and Related Work 2.1 Impact of Stereotyping Stereotyping can influence how we perceive our- selves and others, as well as how we behave to- wards others. For example, Bertrand and Mul- lainathan (2004) found résumés with White names received 50% more invitations to interview than resumes with Black names. More broadly, Bier- nat (2003) found that when one judges individual members of stereotyped groups on stereotyped di- mensions, one does so with reference to within- category standards, e.g. evaluations of men and women on leadership competence may not be di- rectly comparable, as their meaning is tied to differ- ent referents: ‘good’ for a woman does not mean 1The dataset and code used to evaluate the mod- els can be found at https://github.com/groovychoons/ GlobalBias. the same thing as ‘good’ for a man. LLMs trained on data that includes stereotypes or LLMs using non-comprehensive systems to mitigate biases can perpetuate discrimination and social inequality in ways that are difficult to detect and address. 2.2 Axes of Analysis Early work on bias in word embeddings focused on a single dimension, predominantly binary gen- der (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018b; Ethayarajh et al., 2019), and less frequently, race (Caliskan et al., 2017; Garg et al., 2018). Work looking at a single demographic axis often fails to mirror the reality of race and gender being inter- twined. Crenshaw (1989) defines how using a single-axis framework erases Black women’s experience in le- gal and political contexts, as race discrimination tends to be viewed in terms of gender-privileged Blacks, and gender discrimination focuses on race- privileged women. Crenshaw provides a frame- work for understanding how different aspects of a person’s social and political identities combine to create different modes of discrimination and privi- lege, known as intersectionality. There is a growing body of research in the field of intersectional bias, which starts to investigate the nuance of how race and gender interact (Jiang and Fellbaum, 2020). There are several measures defined for evaluating intersectional biases, such as the angry black woman stereotype in contextual word embeddings (May et al., 2019; Tan and Celis, 2019), the contextual word embedding test (CEAT) which also looks at a limited and fixed labelled set of stereotypes (Guo and Caliskan, 2020), and others (Lepori, 2020; Cao et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2023). 2.3 Stereotype Datasets This paper builds on previous work using stereo- types as a means of exploring characteristics that are observed to be associated with specific demo- graphic groups, reinforcing established social hi- erarchies (Greenwald et al., 1998; Blodgett et al., 2021). A number of datasets have been developed to look specifically at stereotypes, largely focus- ing on using sentence pairs to compare two de- mographic groups (May et al., 2019), a stereotype and anti-stereotype (Zhao et al., 2018a; Nangia et al., 2020; Nadeem et al., 2021), or a question and answer set to compare two groups (Parrish et al., 2022). While valuable, these datasets are all situ- ated within a U.S. context (Blodgett et al., 2021), and are unsuitable for our context of analysing mul- tiple subgroups across a single stereotype. In con- trast, our one-vs-all approach offers more robust statistical power, and reduces the impact of outliers and natural variability in two-group comparisons. In terms of metrics, we posit that perplexity, which Smith et al. (2022) and Smith and Williams (2021) used to compare multiple subgroups in one test, is a suitable method, and thus we develop it further. 2.4 Use of Proper Names There exists measurable statistical tendencies for names to refer to both gender and race demo- graphics (Tzioumis, 2018). May et al. (2019) ob- serves that \\\"tests based on given names more of- ten find a significant association than those based on group terms\\\". Therefore, we use given names as a proxy for ethnicity and gender, based on ev- idence that given names are often used to draw stereotypical conclusions about people by both hu- mans (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003; Dechief and Oreopoulos, 2012) and in LLM outputs (De- Arteaga et al., 2019; Romanov et al., 2019; Maud- slay et al., 2019). Using a range of names for each group intends to mitigate the impact of any single name on the group’s overall results. 3 The Dataset We propose a new dataset named GlobalBias for studying harmful stereotypes, which consists of sets of 10 proper names spanning 40 groups. A summary of key data can be found in Table 2. 3.1 Proper Names Our primary objective is to compile a list of di- verse demographic groups, alongside representa- tive names for each group. In this section, we discuss how we build such a dataset, of specifically 40 distinct groups, starting from existing labeled resources. Our seed dataset of names is the Genni + Eth- nea dataset (Torvik, 2018). It contains over 2 mil- lion names, each annotated with ethnicity and gen-\"\n    ]\n}\nOutput: ", "response": "generations=[[ChatGeneration(text='{\\n    \"query\": \"What is the purpose and significance of RAGAS, a reference-free evaluation framework for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines, as described in the context from Cardiff University?\",\\n    \"answer\": \"RAGAS, or Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment, is a framework introduced by researchers at Cardiff University for the evaluation of RAG pipelines.

For instance, for evaluating faithfulness, we used the following prompt: Faithfulness measures the information consistency of the answer against the given context.

An example output can be seen in Table 1. We present both quantitative and qual- itative analyses of representational harms caused by stereotypical outputs. The results highlight the magnitude of stereotypical bias across both open and closed-sourced LLMs. From this, this work presents the following contributions: 1. the GlobalBias1 dataset for studying harm- ful stereotypes, which consists of 876,000 sentences for 40 distinct gender-by-ethnicity groups 2. an analysis of which stereotypes are surfaced for each group by a number of LMs, and the extent and nature of harm caused by the these stereotypes, particularly for intersec- tional groups 3. the finding that larger models have more stereotypical outputs, even when explicitly in- structed to avoid stereotypes and clichés 4. the finding that bias stays consistent across model’s internal representation and outputs, contrary to claims in previous work in the field. 2 Background and Related Work 2.1 Impact of Stereotyping Stereotyping can influence how we perceive our- selves and others, as well as how we behave to- wards others. For example, Bertrand and Mul- lainathan (2004) found résumés with White names received 50% more invitations to interview than resumes with Black names. More broadly, Bier- nat (2003) found that when one judges individual members of stereotyped groups on stereotyped di- mensions, one does so with reference to within- category standards, e.g. evaluations of men and women on leadership competence may not be di- rectly comparable, as their meaning is tied to differ- ent referents: ‘good’ for a woman does not mean 1The dataset and code used to evaluate the mod- els can be found at https://github.com/groovychoons/ GlobalBias. the same thing as ‘good’ for a man. LLMs trained on data that includes stereotypes or LLMs using non-comprehensive systems to mitigate biases can perpetuate discrimination and social inequality in ways that are difficult to detect and address. 2.2 Axes of Analysis Early work on bias in word embeddings focused on a single dimension, predominantly binary gen- der (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018b; Ethayarajh et al., 2019), and less frequently, race (Caliskan et al., 2017; Garg et al., 2018). Work looking at a single demographic axis often fails to mirror the reality of race and gender being inter- twined. Crenshaw (1989) defines how using a single-axis framework erases Black women’s experience in le- gal and political contexts, as race discrimination tends to be viewed in terms of gender-privileged Blacks, and gender discrimination focuses on race- privileged women. Crenshaw provides a frame- work for understanding how different aspects of a person’s social and political identities combine to create different modes of discrimination and privi- lege, known as intersectionality. There is a growing body of research in the field of intersectional bias, which starts to investigate the nuance of how race and gender interact (Jiang and Fellbaum, 2020). There are several measures defined for evaluating intersectional biases, such as the angry black woman stereotype in contextual word embeddings (May et al., 2019; Tan and Celis, 2019), the contextual word embedding test (CEAT) which also looks at a limited and fixed labelled set of stereotypes (Guo and Caliskan, 2020), and others (Lepori, 2020; Cao et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2023). 2.3 Stereotype Datasets This paper builds on previous work using stereo- types as a means of exploring characteristics that are observed to be associated with specific demo- graphic groups, reinforcing established social hi- erarchies (Greenwald et al., 1998; Blodgett et al., 2021). A number of datasets have been developed to look specifically at stereotypes, largely focus- ing on using sentence pairs to compare two de- mographic groups (May et al., 2019), a stereotype and anti-stereotype (Zhao et al., 2018a; Nangia et al., 2020; Nadeem et al., 2021), or a question and answer set to compare two groups (Parrish et al., 2022). While valuable, these datasets are all situ- ated within a U.S. context (Blodgett et al., 2021), and are unsuitable for our context of analysing mul- tiple subgroups across a single stereotype. In con- trast, our one-vs-all approach offers more robust statistical power, and reduces the impact of outliers and natural variability in two-group comparisons. In terms of metrics, we posit that perplexity, which Smith et al. (2022) and Smith and Williams (2021) used to compare multiple subgroups in one test, is a suitable method, and thus we develop it further. 2.4 Use of Proper Names There exists measurable statistical tendencies for names to refer to both gender and race demo- graphics (Tzioumis, 2018). May et al. (2019) ob- serves that \\\"tests based on given names more of- ten find a significant association than those based on group terms\\\". Therefore, we use given names as a proxy for ethnicity and gender, based on ev- idence that given names are often used to draw stereotypical conclusions about people by both hu- mans (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003; Dechief and Oreopoulos, 2012) and in LLM outputs (De- Arteaga et al., 2019; Romanov et al., 2019; Maud- slay et al., 2019). Using a range of names for each group intends to mitigate the impact of any single name on the group’s overall results. 3 The Dataset We propose a new dataset named GlobalBias for studying harmful stereotypes, which consists of sets of 10 proper names spanning 40 groups. A summary of key data can be found in Table 2. 3.1 Proper Names Our primary objective is to compile a list of di- verse demographic groups, alongside representa- tive names for each group. In this section, we discuss how we build such a dataset, of specifically 40 distinct groups, starting from existing labeled resources. Our seed dataset of names is the Genni + Eth- nea dataset (Torvik, 2018). It contains over 2 mil- lion names, each annotated with ethnicity and gen-\"\n    ]\n}\nOutput: ", "response": "generations=[[ChatGeneration(text='{\\n    \"query\": \"How does the ResNet architecture contribute to vowel classification in the context of spectrogram interpretation by neural networks?\",\\n    \"answer\": \"The ResNet architecture contributes to vowel classification by effectively learning discriminative patterns in spectrograms, which are visual representations of the frequency content of a speech signal over time.

We can then verify to what extent our metrics agree with human assessments of faithfulness, answer relevance and context relevance. Since we are not aware of any publicly available datasets that could be used for this purpose, we created a new dataset, which we refer to as WikiEval4. To construct the dataset, we first selected 50 Wikipedia pages cov- ering events that have happened since the start of 20225. In selecting these pages, we prioritised those with recent edits. For each of the 50 pages, we then asked ChatGPT to suggest a question that can be answered based on the introductory section of the page, using the following prompt: Your task is to formulate a question from given context satisfying the rules given below: 1. The question should be fully answered from the given context. 2. The question should be framed from a part that contains non-trivial informa- tion. 3. The answer should not contain any 4https://huggingface.co/datasets/ explodinggradients/WikiEval 5That is, beyond the reported training cutoff of the model we used in our experiments. (2) links. 4. The question should be of moderate difficulty. 5. The question must be reasonable and must be understood and responded to by humans. 6. Do not use phrases that ’provided con- text’, etc in the question context: We also used ChatGPT to answer the generated question, when given the corresponding introduc- tory section as context, using the following prompt: Answer the question using the informa- tion from the given context. question: [question] context: [context] All questions were annotated along the three con- sidered quality dimensions by two annotators. Both annotators were fluent in English and were given clear instructions about the meaning of the three considered quality dimensions. For faithfulness and context relevance, the two annotators agreed in around 95% of cases. For answer relevance, they agreed in around 90% of the cases. Disagreements were resolved after a discussion between the anno- tators. Faithfulness To obtain human judgements about faithfulness, we first used ChatGPT to answer the question without access to any additional context. We then asked the annotators to judge which of the two answers was the most faithful (i.e. the standard one or the one generated without context), given the question and corresponding Wikipedia page. Answer relevance We first used ChatGPT to obtain candidate answers with lower answer rel- evance, using the following prompt: Answer the given question in an incom- plete manner. question: [question] We then asked human annotators to compare this answer, and indicate which of the two answers had the highest answer relevance. Context relevance To measure this aspect, we first added additional sentences to the context by scraping back-links to the corresponding Wikipedia page.

For the few pages with- out any back-links, we instead used ChatGPT to complete the given context. 5 Experiments Table 1 analyses the agreement between the met- rics proposed in Section 3 and the human assess- ments from the proposed WikiEval dataset. Each WikiEval instance requires the model to compare two answers or two context fragments. We count how often the answer/context preferred by the model (i.e. with highest estimated faithfulness, an- swer relevance, or context relevance) coincides with the answer/context preferred by the human annotators. We report the results in terms of ac- curacy (i.e. the fraction of instances on which the model agrees with the annotators). To put the results in context, we compare our proposed metrics (shown as RAGAs in Table 1) with two baseline methods. For the first method, shown as GPT Score, we ask ChatGPT to assign a score between 0 and 10 for the three quality dimensions. To this end, we use a prompt that describes the meaning of the quality metric and then asks to score the given answer/context in line with that definition. For instance, for evaluating faithfulness, we used the following prompt: Faithfulness measures the information consistency of the answer against the given context. Any claims that are made in the answer that cannot be deduced from context should be penalized. Given an answer and context, assign a score for faithfulness in the range 0-10. context: [context] answer: [answer] Ties, where the same score is assigned by the LLM to both answer candidates, were broken randomly. The second baseline, shown as GPT Ranking, in- stead asks\",\n        \"<2-hop>\\n\\nConsidering the limitations of using a fixed set of stereotypes and the fact that likelihoods do not always correspond to model outputs (Parrish et al., 2022), in Section 6, we take a lexicon-free ap- proach that utilizes the given names in our dataset in a generation task. An example output can be seen in Table 1. We present both quantitative and qual- itative analyses of representational harms caused by stereotypical outputs. The results highlight the magnitude of stereotypical bias across both open and closed-sourced LLMs. From this, this work presents the following contributions: 1. the GlobalBias1 dataset for studying harm- ful stereotypes, which consists of 876,000 sentences for 40 distinct gender-by-ethnicity groups 2. an analysis of which stereotypes are surfaced for each group by a number of LMs, and the extent and nature of harm caused by the these stereotypes, particularly for intersec- tional groups 3. the finding that larger models have more stereotypical outputs, even when explicitly in- structed to avoid stereotypes and clichés 4. the finding that bias stays consistent across model’s internal representation and outputs, contrary to claims in previous work in the field. 2 Background and Related Work 2.1 Impact of Stereotyping Stereotyping can influence how we perceive our- selves and others, as well as how we behave to- wards others. For example, Bertrand and Mul- lainathan (2004) found résumés with White names received 50% more invitations to interview than resumes with Black names. More broadly, Bier- nat (2003) found that when one judges individual members of stereotyped groups on stereotyped di- mensions, one does so with reference to within- category standards, e.g. evaluations of men and women on leadership competence may not be di- rectly comparable, as their meaning is tied to differ- ent referents: ‘good’ for a woman does not mean 1The dataset and code used to evaluate the mod- els can be found at https://github.com/groovychoons/ GlobalBias. the same thing as ‘good’ for a man. LLMs trained on data that includes stereotypes or LLMs using non-comprehensive systems to mitigate biases can perpetuate discrimination and social inequality in ways that are difficult to detect and address. 2.2 Axes of Analysis Early work on bias in word embeddings focused on a single dimension, predominantly binary gen- der (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018b; Ethayarajh et al., 2019), and less frequently, race (Caliskan et al., 2017; Garg et al., 2018). Work looking at a single demographic axis often fails to mirror the reality of race and gender being inter- twined. Crenshaw (1989) defines how using a single-axis framework erases Black women’s experience in le- gal and political contexts, as race discrimination tends to be viewed in terms of gender-privileged Blacks, and gender discrimination focuses on race- privileged women. Crenshaw provides a frame- work for understanding how different aspects of a person’s social and political identities combine to create different modes of discrimination and privi- lege, known as intersectionality. There is a growing body of research in the field of intersectional bias, which starts to investigate the nuance of how race and gender interact (Jiang and Fellbaum, 2020). There are several measures defined for evaluating intersectional biases, such as the angry black woman stereotype in contextual word embeddings (May et al., 2019; Tan and Celis, 2019), the contextual word embedding test (CEAT) which also looks at a limited and fixed labelled set of stereotypes (Guo and Caliskan, 2020), and others (Lepori, 2020; Cao et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2023). 2.3 Stereotype Datasets This paper builds on previous work using stereo- types as a means of exploring characteristics that are observed to be associated with specific demo- graphic groups, reinforcing established social hi- erarchies (Greenwald et al., 1998; Blodgett et al., 2021). A number of datasets have been developed to look specifically at stereotypes, largely focus- ing on using sentence pairs to compare two de- mographic groups (May et al., 2019), a stereotype and anti-stereotype (Zhao et al., 2018a; Nangia et al., 2020; Nadeem et al., 2021), or a question and answer set to compare two groups (Parrish et al., 2022).

We count how often the answer/context preferred by the model (i.e. with highest estimated faithfulness, an- swer relevance, or context relevance) coincides with the answer/context preferred by the human annotators. We report the results in terms of ac- curacy (i.e. the fraction of instances on which the model agrees with the annotators). To put the results in context, we compare our proposed metrics (shown as RAGAs in Table 1) with two baseline methods. For the first method, shown as GPT Score, we ask ChatGPT to assign a score between 0 and 10 for the three quality dimensions. To this end, we use a prompt that describes the meaning of the quality metric and then asks to score the given answer/context in line with that definition. For instance, for evaluating faithfulness, we used the following prompt: Faithfulness measures the information consistency of the answer against the given context. Any claims that are made in the answer that cannot be deduced from context should be penalized. Given an answer and context, assign a score for faithfulness in the range 0-10. context: [context] answer: [answer] Ties, where the same score is assigned by the LLM to both answer candidates, were broken randomly. The second baseline, shown as GPT Ranking, in- stead asks\",\n        \"<2-hop>\\n\\nConsidering the limitations of using a fixed set of stereotypes and the fact that likelihoods do not always correspond to model outputs (Parrish et al., 2022), in Section 6, we take a lexicon-free ap- proach that utilizes the given names in our dataset in a generation task. An example output can be seen in Table 1. We present both quantitative and qual- itative analyses of representational harms caused by stereotypical outputs. The results highlight the magnitude of stereotypical bias across both open and closed-sourced LLMs. From this, this work presents the following contributions: 1. the GlobalBias1 dataset for studying harm- ful stereotypes, which consists of 876,000 sentences for 40 distinct gender-by-ethnicity groups 2. an analysis of which stereotypes are surfaced for each group by a number of LMs, and the extent and nature of harm caused by the these stereotypes, particularly for intersec- tional groups 3. the finding that larger models have more stereotypical outputs, even when explicitly in- structed to avoid stereotypes and clichés 4. the finding that bias stays consistent across model’s internal representation and outputs, contrary to claims in previous work in the field. 2 Background and Related Work 2.1 Impact of Stereotyping Stereotyping can influence how we perceive our- selves and others, as well as how we behave to- wards others. For example, Bertrand and Mul- lainathan (2004) found résumés with White names received 50% more invitations to interview than resumes with Black names. More broadly, Bier- nat (2003) found that when one judges individual members of stereotyped groups on stereotyped di- mensions, one does so with reference to within- category standards, e.g. evaluations of men and women on leadership competence may not be di- rectly comparable, as their meaning is tied to differ- ent referents: ‘good’ for a woman does not mean 1The dataset and code used to evaluate the mod- els can be found at https://github.com/groovychoons/ GlobalBias. the same thing as ‘good’ for a man. LLMs trained on data that includes stereotypes or LLMs using non-comprehensive systems to mitigate biases can perpetuate discrimination and social inequality in ways that are difficult to detect and address. 2.2 Axes of Analysis Early work on bias in word embeddings focused on a single dimension, predominantly binary gen- der (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018b; Ethayarajh et al., 2019), and less frequently, race (Caliskan et al., 2017; Garg et al., 2018). Work looking at a single demographic axis often fails to mirror the reality of race and gender being inter- twined. Crenshaw (1989) defines how using a single-axis framework erases Black women’s experience in le- gal and political contexts, as race discrimination tends to be viewed in terms of gender-privileged Blacks, and gender discrimination focuses on race- privileged women. Crenshaw provides a frame- work for understanding how different aspects of a person’s social and political identities combine to create different modes of discrimination and privi- lege, known as intersectionality. There is a growing body of research in the field of intersectional bias, which starts to investigate the nuance of how race and gender interact (Jiang and Fellbaum, 2020). There are several measures defined for evaluating intersectional biases, such as the angry black woman stereotype in contextual word embeddings (May et al., 2019; Tan and Celis, 2019), the contextual word embedding test (CEAT) which also looks at a limited and fixed labelled set of stereotypes (Guo and Caliskan, 2020), and others (Lepori, 2020; Cao et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2023). 2.3 Stereotype Datasets This paper builds on previous work using stereo- types as a means of exploring characteristics that are observed to be associated with specific demo- graphic groups, reinforcing established social hi- erarchies (Greenwald et al., 1998; Blodgett et al., 2021). A number of datasets have been developed to look specifically at stereotypes, largely focus- ing on using sentence pairs to compare two de- mographic groups (May et al., 2019), a stereotype and anti-stereotype (Zhao et al., 2018a; Nangia et al., 2020; Nadeem et al., 2021), or a question and answer set to compare two groups (Parrish et al., 2022). While valuable, these datasets are all situ- ated within a U.S. context (Blodgett et al., 2021), and are unsuitable for our context of analysing mul- tiple subgroups across a single stereotype. In con- trast, our one-vs-all approach offers more robust statistical power, and reduces the impact of outliers and natural variability in two-group comparisons. In terms of metrics, we posit that perplexity, which Smith et al. (2022) and Smith and Williams (2021) used to compare multiple subgroups in one test, is a suitable method, and thus we develop it further. 2.4 Use of Proper Names There exists measurable statistical tendencies for names to refer to both gender and race demo- graphics (Tzioumis, 2018). May et al. (2019) ob- serves that \\\"tests based on given names more of- ten find a significant association than those based on group terms\\\". Therefore, we use given names as a proxy for ethnicity and gender, based on ev- idence that given names are often used to draw stereotypical conclusions about people by both hu- mans (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003; Dechief and Oreopoulos, 2012) and in LLM outputs (De- Arteaga et al., 2019; Romanov et al., 2019; Maud- slay et al., 2019). Using a range of names for each group intends to mitigate the impact of any single name on the group’s overall results. 3 The Dataset We propose a new dataset named GlobalBias for studying harmful stereotypes, which consists of sets of 10 proper names spanning 40 groups. A summary of key data can be found in Table 2. 3.1 Proper Names Our primary objective is to compile a list of di- verse demographic groups, alongside representa- tive names for each group. In this section, we discuss how we build such a dataset, of specifically 40 distinct groups, starting from existing labeled resources. Our seed dataset of names is the Genni + Eth- nea dataset (Torvik, 2018). It contains over 2 mil- lion names, each annotated with ethnicity and gen-\"\n    ]\n}\nOutput: ", "response": "generations=[[ChatGeneration(text='{\\n    \"query\": \"What is depicted in Figure 4, according to the AI Researcher\\'s context?\",\\n    \"answer\": \"Figure 4, as described in the context, presents CAMs (Class Activation Maps) and a Confusion Matrix for classifying voiced and unvoiced speech with a maximum frequency of 4000 Hz.

The answer relevance score, AR, for question q is then computed as: AR = 1 n n (cid:88) i=1 sim(q, qi) This metric evaluates how closely the generated answer aligns with the initial question or instruc- tion. Context relevance The context c(q) is consid- ered relevant to the extent that it exclusively con- tains information that is needed to answer the ques- tion. In particular, this metric aims to penalise the (1) inclusion of redundant information. To estimate context relevance, given a question q and its con- text c(q), the LLM extracts a subset of sentences, Sext, from c(q) that are crucial to answer q, using the following prompt: Please extract relevant sentences from the provided context that can potentially help answer the following question. If no relevant sentences are found, or if you believe the question cannot be answered from the given context, return the phrase \\\"Insufficient Information\\\". While extract- ing candidate sentences you’re not al- lowed to make any changes to sentences from given context. The context relevance score is then computed as: CR = number of extracted sentences total number of sentences in c(q) 4 The WikiEval Dataset To evaluate the proposed framework, we ideally need examples of question-context-answer triples which are annotated with human judgments. We can then verify to what extent our metrics agree with human assessments of faithfulness, answer relevance and context relevance. Since we are not aware of any publicly available datasets that could be used for this purpose, we created a new dataset, which we refer to as WikiEval4. To construct the dataset, we first selected 50 Wikipedia pages cov- ering events that have happened since the start of 20225. In selecting these pages, we prioritised those with recent edits. For each of the 50 pages, we then asked ChatGPT to suggest a question that can be answered based on the introductory section of the page, using the following prompt: Your task is to formulate a question from given context satisfying the rules given below: 1. The question should be fully answered from the given context. 2. The question should be framed from a part that contains non-trivial informa- tion. 3. The answer should not contain any 4https://huggingface.co/datasets/ explodinggradients/WikiEval 5That is, beyond the reported training cutoff of the model we used in our experiments. (2) links. 4. The question should be of moderate difficulty. 5. The question must be reasonable and must be understood and responded to by humans. 6. Do not use phrases that ’provided con- text’, etc in the question context: We also used ChatGPT to answer the generated question, when given the corresponding introduc- tory section as context, using the following prompt: Answer the question using the informa- tion from the given context. question: [question] context: [context] All questions were annotated along the three con- sidered quality dimensions by two annotators. Both annotators were fluent in English and were given clear instructions about the meaning of the three considered quality dimensions. For faithfulness and context relevance, the two annotators agreed in around 95% of cases. For answer relevance, they agreed in around 90% of the cases. Disagreements were resolved after a discussion between the anno- tators. Faithfulness To obtain human judgements about faithfulness, we first used ChatGPT to answer the question without access to any additional context. We then asked the annotators to judge which of the two answers was the most faithful (i.e. the standard one or the one generated without context), given the question and corresponding Wikipedia page. Answer relevance We first used ChatGPT to obtain candidate answers with lower answer rel- evance, using the following prompt: Answer the given question in an incom- plete manner. question: [question] We then asked human annotators to compare this answer, and indicate which of the two answers had the highest answer relevance. Context relevance To measure this aspect, we first added additional sentences to the context by scraping back-links to the corresponding Wikipedia page. In this way, we were able to add information to the context that was related but less relevant for Faith. Ans. Rel. Cont. Rel.

The answer relevance score, AR, for question q is then computed as: AR = 1 n n (cid:88) i=1 sim(q, qi) This metric evaluates how closely the generated answer aligns with the initial question or instruc- tion. Context relevance The context c(q) is consid- ered relevant to the extent that it exclusively con- tains information that is needed to answer the ques- tion. In particular, this metric aims to penalise the (1) inclusion of redundant information. To estimate context relevance, given a question q and its con- text c(q), the LLM extracts a subset of sentences, Sext, from c(q) that are crucial to answer q, using the following prompt: Please extract relevant sentences from the provided context that can potentially help answer the following question. If no relevant sentences are found, or if you believe the question cannot be answered from the given context, return the phrase \\\"Insufficient Information\\\". While extract- ing candidate sentences you’re not al- lowed to make any changes to sentences from given context. The context relevance score is then computed as: CR = number of extracted sentences total number of sentences in c(q) 4 The WikiEval Dataset To evaluate the proposed framework, we ideally need examples of question-context-answer triples which are annotated with human judgments. We can then verify to what extent our metrics agree with human assessments of faithfulness, answer relevance and context relevance. Since we are not aware of any publicly available datasets that could be used for this purpose, we created a new dataset, which we refer to as WikiEval4. To construct the dataset, we first selected 50 Wikipedia pages cov- ering events that have happened since the start of 20225. In selecting these pages, we prioritised those with recent edits. For each of the 50 pages, we then asked ChatGPT to suggest a question that can be answered based on the introductory section of the page, using the following prompt: Your task is to formulate a question from given context satisfying the rules given below: 1. The question should be fully answered from the given context. 2. The question should be framed from a part that contains non-trivial informa- tion. 3. The answer should not contain any 4https://huggingface.co/datasets/ explodinggradients/WikiEval 5That is, beyond the reported training cutoff of the model we used in our experiments. (2) links. 4. The question should be of moderate difficulty. 5. The question must be reasonable and must be understood and responded to by humans. 6. Do not use phrases that ’provided con- text’, etc in the question context: We also used ChatGPT to answer the generated question, when given the corresponding introduc- tory section as context, using the following prompt: Answer the question using the informa- tion from the given context. question: [question] context: [context] All questions were annotated along the three con- sidered quality dimensions by two annotators. Both annotators were fluent in English and were given clear instructions about the meaning of the three considered quality dimensions. For faithfulness and context relevance, the two annotators agreed in around 95% of cases. For answer relevance, they agreed in around 90% of the cases. Disagreements were resolved after a discussion between the anno- tators. Faithfulness To obtain human judgements about faithfulness, we first used ChatGPT to answer the question without access to any additional context. We then asked the annotators to judge which of the two answers was the most faithful (i.e. the standard one or the one generated without context), given the question and corresponding Wikipedia page. Answer relevance We first used ChatGPT to obtain candidate answers with lower answer rel- evance, using the following prompt: Answer the given question in an incom- plete manner. question: [question] We then asked human annotators to compare this answer, and indicate which of the two answers had the highest answer relevance. Context relevance To measure this aspect, we first added additional sentences to the context by scraping back-links to the corresponding Wikipedia page. In this way, we were able to add information to the context that was related but less relevant for Faith. Ans. Rel. Cont. Rel.

For the few pages with- out any back-links, we instead used ChatGPT to complete the given context. 5 Experiments Table 1 analyses the agreement between the met- rics proposed in Section 3 and the human assess- ments from the proposed WikiEval dataset. Each WikiEval instance requires the model to compare two answers or two context fragments. We count how often the answer/context preferred by the model (i.e. with highest estimated faithfulness, an- swer relevance, or context relevance) coincides with the answer/context preferred by the human annotators. We report the results in terms of ac- curacy (i.e. the fraction of instances on which the model agrees with the annotators). To put the results in context, we compare our proposed metrics (shown as RAGAs in Table 1) with two baseline methods. For the first method, shown as GPT Score, we ask ChatGPT to assign a score between 0 and 10 for the three quality dimensions. To this end, we use a prompt that describes the meaning of the quality metric and then asks to score the given answer/context in line with that definition. For instance, for evaluating faithfulness, we used the following prompt: Faithfulness measures the information consistency of the answer against the given context. Any claims that are made in the answer that cannot be deduced from context should be penalized. Given an answer and context, assign a score for faithfulness in the range 0-10. context: [context] answer: [answer] Ties, where the same score is assigned by the LLM to both answer candidates, were broken randomly. The second baseline, shown as GPT Ranking, in- stead asks\",\n        \"<2-hop>\\n\\nConsidering the limitations of using a fixed set of stereotypes and the fact that likelihoods do not always correspond to model outputs (Parrish et al., 2022), in Section 6, we take a lexicon-free ap- proach that utilizes the given names in our dataset in a generation task. An example output can be seen in Table 1. We present both quantitative and qual- itative analyses of representational harms caused by stereotypical outputs. The results highlight the magnitude of stereotypical bias across both open and closed-sourced LLMs. From this, this work presents the following contributions: 1. the GlobalBias1 dataset for studying harm- ful stereotypes, which consists of 876,000 sentences for 40 distinct gender-by-ethnicity groups 2. an analysis of which stereotypes are surfaced for each group by a number of LMs, and the extent and nature of harm caused by the these stereotypes, particularly for intersec- tional groups 3. the finding that larger models have more stereotypical outputs, even when explicitly in- structed to avoid stereotypes and clichés 4. the finding that bias stays consistent across model’s internal representation and outputs, contrary to claims in previous work in the field. 2 Background and Related Work 2.1 Impact of Stereotyping Stereotyping can influence how we perceive our- selves and others, as well as how we behave to- wards others. For example, Bertrand and Mul- lainathan (2004) found résumés with White names received 50% more invitations to interview than resumes with Black names. More broadly, Bier- nat (2003) found that when one judges individual members of stereotyped groups on stereotyped di- mensions, one does so with reference to within- category standards, e.g. evaluations of men and women on leadership competence may not be di- rectly comparable, as their meaning is tied to differ- ent referents: ‘good’ for a woman does not mean 1The dataset and code used to evaluate the mod- els can be found at https://github.com/groovychoons/ GlobalBias. the same thing as ‘good’ for a man. LLMs trained on data that includes stereotypes or LLMs using non-comprehensive systems to mitigate biases can perpetuate discrimination and social inequality in ways that are difficult to detect and address. 2.2 Axes of Analysis Early work on bias in word embeddings focused on a single dimension, predominantly binary gen- der (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018b; Ethayarajh et al., 2019), and less frequently, race (Caliskan et al., 2017; Garg et al., 2018). Work looking at a single demographic axis often fails to mirror the reality of race and gender being inter- twined. Crenshaw (1989) defines how using a single-axis framework erases Black women’s experience in le- gal and political contexts, as race discrimination tends to be viewed in terms of gender-privileged Blacks, and gender discrimination focuses on race- privileged women. Crenshaw provides a frame- work for understanding how different aspects of a person’s social and political identities combine to create different modes of discrimination and privi- lege, known as intersectionality. There is a growing body of research in the field of intersectional bias, which starts to investigate the nuance of how race and gender interact (Jiang and Fellbaum, 2020). There are several measures defined for evaluating intersectional biases, such as the angry black woman stereotype in contextual word embeddings (May et al., 2019; Tan and Celis, 2019), the contextual word embedding test (CEAT) which also looks at a limited and fixed labelled set of stereotypes (Guo and Caliskan, 2020), and others (Lepori, 2020; Cao et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2023). 2.3 Stereotype Datasets This paper builds on previous work using stereo- types as a means of exploring characteristics that are observed to be associated with specific demo- graphic groups, reinforcing established social hi- erarchies (Greenwald et al., 1998; Blodgett et al., 2021). A number of datasets have been developed to look specifically at stereotypes, largely focus- ing on using sentence pairs to compare two de- mographic groups (May et al., 2019), a stereotype and anti-stereotype (Zhao et al., 2018a; Nangia et al., 2020; Nadeem et al., 2021), or a question and answer set to compare two groups (Parrish et al., 2022). While valuable, these datasets are all situ- ated within a U.S. context (Blodgett et al., 2021), and are unsuitable for our context of analysing mul- tiple subgroups across a single stereotype. In con- trast, our one-vs-all approach offers more robust statistical power, and reduces the impact of outliers and natural variability in two-group comparisons. In terms of metrics, we posit that perplexity, which Smith et al. (2022) and Smith and Williams (2021) used to compare multiple subgroups in one test, is a suitable method, and thus we develop it further. 2.4 Use of Proper Names There exists measurable statistical tendencies for names to refer to both gender and race demo- graphics (Tzioumis, 2018). May et al. (2019) ob- serves that \\\"tests based on given names more of- ten find a significant association than those based on group terms\\\". Therefore, we use given names as a proxy for ethnicity and gender, based on ev- idence that given names are often used to draw stereotypical conclusions about people by both hu- mans (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003; Dechief and Oreopoulos, 2012) and in LLM outputs (De- Arteaga et al., 2019; Romanov et al., 2019; Maud- slay et al., 2019). Using a range of names for each group intends to mitigate the impact of any single name on the group’s overall results. 3 The Dataset We propose a new dataset named GlobalBias for studying harmful stereotypes, which consists of sets of 10 proper names spanning 40 groups. A summary of key data can be found in Table 2. 3.1 Proper Names Our primary objective is to compile a list of di- verse demographic groups, alongside representa- tive names for each group. In this section, we discuss how we build such a dataset, of specifically 40 distinct groups, starting from existing labeled resources. Our seed dataset of names is the Genni + Eth- nea dataset (Torvik, 2018).

Visualization techniques, such as highlight- ing the important areas in an image for a specific prediction, are commonly used [21,15]. Other approaches include sensitivity analysis, Taylor decomposition, and backward propagation techniques [16]. Explaining Spectrograms in Machine Learning Class activation maps (CAMs) are visualization techniques to explain the decision-making process of deep neural networks, specifically in CNNs for image classification tasks [26,21,15]. CAMs provide valuable insights into the influential regions within an image that contribute to predicting a particular class label. By leveraging the gradients during the backward propagation process, CAMs capture the importance of spatial locations, highlighting the regions that sig- nificantly influence the final classification decision. These maps have proven to be effective in explaining the reasoning behind deep learning models, allowing researchers and practitioners to comprehend which areas of an image play a crucial role in making accurate predictions. CAMs offer a visual explanation by generating heatmaps that emphasize the relevant regions responsible for the classification decision. Explanations of deep learning models have been widely explored in vari- ous domains, including image classification, pattern recognition [1], and medical applications [9,19]. While activation mapping has been extensively applied in visual recognition tasks, its direct application to speech recognition is less com- mon. One example is the use of CAM to explain the results of detecting oral cancer speech using a ResNet-based classifier with spectrograms as input [5]. In this study, we propose adapting the concept of CAMs to spectrograms with the aim of identifying the specific frequency regions that provide the most informative cues for speech classification tasks.\"\n}\nOutput: ", "response": "generations=[[ChatGeneration(text='{\\n    \"query\": \"What is VGGNet in the field of neural networks?\",\\n    \"answer\": \"VGGNet is a type of large neural network that has been used for image processing tasks, including speech recognition when adapted to process spectrograms.

RAG systems are composed of a retrieval and an LLM based generation module, and provide LLMs with knowledge from a reference textual database, which enables them to act as a natu- ral language layer between a user and textual databases, reducing the risk of hallucinations. Evaluating RAG architectures is, however, chal- lenging because there are several dimensions to consider: the ability of the retrieval system to identify relevant and focused context passages, the ability of the LLM to exploit such passages in a faithful way, or the quality of the gener- ation itself. With RAGAS, we put forward a suite of metrics which can be used to evaluate these different dimensions without having to rely on ground truth human annotations. We posit that such a framework can crucially con- tribute to faster evaluation cycles of RAG archi- tectures, which is especially important given the fast adoption of LLMs. 1 Introduction Language Models (LMs) capture a vast amount of knowledge about the world, which allows them to answer questions without accessing any exter- nal sources. This idea of LMs as repositories of knowledge emerged shortly after the introduction of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and became more firmly established with the introduction of ever larger LMs (Roberts et al., 2020). While the most recent Large Language Models (LLMs) capture enough knowledge to rival human performance across a wide variety of question answering bench- marks (Bubeck et al., 2023), the idea of using LLMs as knowledge bases still has two fundamen- tal limitations. First, LLMs are not able to answer questions about events that have happened after they were trained. Second, even the largest models struggle to memorise knowledge that is only rarely mentioned in the training corpus (Kandpal et al., 2022; Mallen et al., 2023). The standard solution to these issues is to rely on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lee et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2020; Guu et al., 2020). Answering a question then essentially involves retrieving relevant pas- sages from a corpus and feeding these passages, along with the original question, to the LM. While initial approaches relied on specialised LMs for retrieval-augmented language modelling (Khandel- wal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022), recent work has suggested that simply adding retrieved docu- ments to the input of a standard LM can also work well (Khattab et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023), thus making it possible to use retrieval- augmented strategies in combination with LLMs that are only available through APIs. While the usefulness of retrieval-augmented strategies is clear, their implementation requires a significant amount of tuning, as the overall per- formance will be affected by the retrieval model, the considered corpus, the LM, or the prompt for- mulation, among others. Automated evaluation of retrieval-augmented systems is thus paramount. In practice, RAG systems are often evaluated in terms of the language modelling task itself, i.e. by mea- suring perplexity on some reference corpus. How- ever, such evaluations are not always predictive of downstream performance (Wang et al., 2023c). Moreover, this evaluation strategy relies on the LM probabilities, which are not accessible for some closed models (e.g. ChatGPT and GPT-4). Ques- tion answering is another common evaluation task, but usually only datasets with short extractive an- swers are considered, which may not be represen- tative of how the system will be used. To address these issues, in this paper we present RAGAS1, a framework for the automated assess- 1RAGAS available explodinggradients/ragas. is at https://github.com/ ment of retrieval augmented generation systems. We focus on settings where reference answers may not be available, and where we want to estimate different proxies for correctness, in addition to the usefulness of the retrieved passages. The RAGAS framework provides an integration with both llama- index and Langchain, the most widely used frame- works for building RAG solutions, thus enabling developers to easily integrate RAGAS into their standard workflow. 2 Related Work Estimating faithfulness using LLMs The prob- lem of detecting hallucinations in LLM generated responses has been extensively studied (Ji et al., 2023). Several authors have suggested the idea of predicting factuality using a few-shot prompt- ing strategy (Zhang et al., 2023). Recent analy- ses, however, suggest that existing models struggle with detecting hallucination when using standard prompting strategies (Li et al., 2023; Azaria and Mitchell, 2023). Other approaches rely on linking the generated responses to facts from an external knowledge base (Min et al., 2023), but this is not always possible. Yet another strategy is to inspect the probabili- ties assigned to individual tokens, where we would expect the model to be less confident in halluci- nated answers than in factual ones. For instance, BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) estimates factuality by looking at the conditional probability of the gen- erated text given the input. Kadavath et al. (2022) use a variation of this idea. Starting from the ob- servation that LLMs provide well-calibrated proba- bilities when answering multiple-choice questions, they essentially convert the problem of validating model generated answers into a multiple-choice question which asks whether the answer is true or false. Rather than looking at the output probabil- ities, Azaria and Mitchell (2023) propose to train a supervised classifier on the weights from one of the hidden layers of the LLM, to predict whether a given statement is true or not. While the approach performs well, the need to access the hidden states of the model makes it unsuitable for systems that access LLMs through an API. For models that do not provide access to token probabilities, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, differ- ent methods are needed. SelfCheckGPT (Manakul et al., 2023) addresses this problem by instead sam- pling multiple answers. Their core idea is that factual answers are more stable: when an answer\",\n        \"<2-hop>\\n\\n3 2 0 2 p e S 6 2 ] L C . s c [ 1 v 7 1 2 5 1 . 9 0 3 2 : v i X r a RAGAS: Automated Evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation Shahul Es†, Jithin James†, Luis Espinosa-Anke∗♢, Steven Schockaert∗ †Exploding Gradients ∗CardiffNLP, Cardiff University, United Kingdom ♢AMPLYFI, United Kingdom shahules786@gmail.com,jamesjithin97@gmail.com {espinosa-ankel,schockaerts1}@cardiff.ac.uk Abstract We introduce RAGAS (Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment), a framework for reference-free evaluation of Retrieval Aug- mented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

First, LLMs are not able to answer questions about events that have happened after they were trained. Second, even the largest models struggle to memorise knowledge that is only rarely mentioned in the training corpus (Kandpal et al., 2022; Mallen et al., 2023). The standard solution to these issues is to rely on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lee et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2020; Guu et al., 2020). Answering a question then essentially involves retrieving relevant pas- sages from a corpus and feeding these passages, along with the original question, to the LM. While initial approaches relied on specialised LMs for retrieval-augmented language modelling (Khandel- wal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022), recent work has suggested that simply adding retrieved docu- ments to the input of a standard LM can also work well (Khattab et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023), thus making it possible to use retrieval- augmented strategies in combination with LLMs that are only available through APIs. While the usefulness of retrieval-augmented strategies is clear, their implementation requires a significant amount of tuning, as the overall per- formance will be affected by the retrieval model, the considered corpus, the LM, or the prompt for- mulation, among others. Automated evaluation of retrieval-augmented systems is thus paramount. In practice, RAG systems are often evaluated in terms of the language modelling task itself, i.e. by mea- suring perplexity on some reference corpus. How- ever, such evaluations are not always predictive of downstream performance (Wang et al., 2023c). Moreover, this evaluation strategy relies on the LM probabilities, which are not accessible for some closed models (e.g. ChatGPT and GPT-4). Ques- tion answering is another common evaluation task, but usually only datasets with short extractive an- swers are considered, which may not be represen- tative of how the system will be used. To address these issues, in this paper we present RAGAS1, a framework for the automated assess- 1RAGAS available explodinggradients/ragas. is at https://github.com/ ment of retrieval augmented generation systems. We focus on settings where reference answers may not be available, and where we want to estimate different proxies for correctness, in addition to the usefulness of the retrieved passages. The RAGAS framework provides an integration with both llama- index and Langchain, the most widely used frame- works for building RAG solutions, thus enabling developers to easily integrate RAGAS into their standard workflow. 2 Related Work Estimating faithfulness using LLMs The prob- lem of detecting hallucinations in LLM generated responses has been extensively studied (Ji et al., 2023). Several authors have suggested the idea of predicting factuality using a few-shot prompt- ing strategy (Zhang et al., 2023). Recent analy- ses, however, suggest that existing models struggle with detecting hallucination when using standard prompting strategies (Li et al., 2023; Azaria and Mitchell, 2023). Other approaches rely on linking the generated responses to facts from an external knowledge base (Min et al., 2023), but this is not always possible. Yet another strategy is to inspect the probabili- ties assigned to individual tokens, where we would expect the model to be less confident in halluci- nated answers than in factual ones. For instance, BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) estimates factuality by looking at the conditional probability of the gen- erated text given the input. Kadavath et al. (2022) use a variation of this idea. Starting from the ob- servation that LLMs provide well-calibrated proba- bilities when answering multiple-choice questions, they essentially convert the problem of validating model generated answers into a multiple-choice question which asks whether the answer is true or false. Rather than looking at the output probabil- ities, Azaria and Mitchell (2023) propose to train a supervised classifier on the weights from one of the hidden layers of the LLM, to predict whether a given statement is true or not. While the approach performs well, the need to access the hidden states of the model makes it unsuitable for systems that access LLMs through an API. For models that do not provide access to token probabilities, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, differ- ent methods are needed. SelfCheckGPT (Manakul et al., 2023) addresses this problem by instead sam- pling multiple answers. Their core idea is that factual answers are more stable: when an answer\",\n        \"<2-hop>\\n\\n3 2 0 2 p e S 6 2 ] L C . s c [ 1 v 7 1 2 5 1 . 9 0 3 2 : v i X r a RAGAS: Automated Evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation Shahul Es†, Jithin James†, Luis Espinosa-Anke∗♢, Steven Schockaert∗ †Exploding Gradients ∗CardiffNLP, Cardiff University, United Kingdom ♢AMPLYFI, United Kingdom shahules786@gmail.com,jamesjithin97@gmail.com {espinosa-ankel,schockaerts1}@cardiff.ac.uk Abstract We introduce RAGAS (Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment), a framework for reference-free evaluation of Retrieval Aug- mented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

Several authors have suggested the idea of predicting factuality using a few-shot prompt- ing strategy (Zhang et al., 2023). Recent analy- ses, however, suggest that existing models struggle with detecting hallucination when using standard prompting strategies (Li et al., 2023; Azaria and Mitchell, 2023). Other approaches rely on linking the generated responses to facts from an external knowledge base (Min et al., 2023), but this is not always possible. Yet another strategy is to inspect the probabili- ties assigned to individual tokens, where we would expect the model to be less confident in halluci- nated answers than in factual ones. For instance, BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) estimates factuality by looking at the conditional probability of the gen- erated text given the input. Kadavath et al. (2022) use a variation of this idea. Starting from the ob- servation that LLMs provide well-calibrated proba- bilities when answering multiple-choice questions, they essentially convert the problem of validating model generated answers into a multiple-choice question which asks whether the answer is true or false. Rather than looking at the output probabil- ities, Azaria and Mitchell (2023) propose to train a supervised classifier on the weights from one of the hidden layers of the LLM, to predict whether a given statement is true or not. While the approach performs well, the need to access the hidden states of the model makes it unsuitable for systems that access LLMs through an API. For models that do not provide access to token probabilities, such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, differ- ent methods are needed. SelfCheckGPT (Manakul et al., 2023) addresses this problem by instead sam- pling multiple answers. Their core idea is that factual answers are more stable: when an answer\",\n        \"<2-hop>\\n\\n3 2 0 2 p e S 6 2 ] L C . s c [ 1 v 7 1 2 5 1 . 9 0 3 2 : v i X r a RAGAS: Automated Evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation Shahul Es†, Jithin James†, Luis Espinosa-Anke∗♢, Steven Schockaert∗ †Exploding Gradients ∗CardiffNLP, Cardiff University, United Kingdom ♢AMPLYFI, United Kingdom shahules786@gmail.com,jamesjithin97@gmail.com {espinosa-ankel,schockaerts1}@cardiff.ac.uk Abstract We introduce RAGAS (Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment), a framework for reference-free evaluation of Retrieval Aug- mented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

This idea of LMs as repositories of knowledge emerged shortly after the introduction of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and became more firmly established with the introduction of ever larger LMs (Roberts et al., 2020). While the most recent Large Language Models (LLMs) capture enough knowledge to rival human performance across a wide variety of question answering bench- marks (Bubeck et al., 2023), the idea of using LLMs as knowledge bases still has two fundamen- tal limitations. First, LLMs are not able to answer questions about events that have happened after they were trained. Second, even the largest models struggle to memorise knowledge that is only rarely mentioned in the training corpus (Kandpal et al., 2022; Mallen et al., 2023). The standard solution to these issues is to rely on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lee et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2020; Guu et al., 2020). Answering a question then essentially involves retrieving relevant pas- sages from a corpus and feeding these passages, along with the original question, to the LM. While initial approaches relied on specialised LMs for retrieval-augmented language modelling (Khandel- wal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022), recent work has suggested that simply adding retrieved docu- ments to the input of a standard LM can also work well (Khattab et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023), thus making it possible to use retrieval- augmented strategies in combination with LLMs that are only available through APIs. While the usefulness of retrieval-augmented strategies is clear, their implementation requires a significant amount of tuning, as the overall per- formance will be affected by the retrieval model, the considered corpus, the LM, or the prompt for- mulation, among others. Automated evaluation of retrieval-augmented systems is thus paramount. In practice, RAG systems are often evaluated in terms of the language modelling task itself, i.e. by mea- suring perplexity on some reference corpus. How- ever, such evaluations are not always predictive of downstream performance (Wang et al., 2023c). Moreover, this evaluation strategy relies on the LM probabilities, which are not accessible for some closed models (e.g. ChatGPT and GPT-4). Ques- tion answering is another common evaluation task, but usually only datasets with short extractive an- swers are considered, which may not be represen- tative of how the system will be used.

We posit that such a framework can crucially con- tribute to faster evaluation cycles of RAG archi- tectures, which is especially important given the fast adoption of LLMs. 1 Introduction Language Models (LMs) capture a vast amount of knowledge about the world, which allows them to answer questions without accessing any exter- nal sources. This idea of LMs as repositories of knowledge emerged shortly after the introduction of BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and became more firmly established with the introduction of ever larger LMs (Roberts et al., 2020). While the most recent Large Language Models (LLMs) capture enough knowledge to rival human performance across a wide variety of question answering bench- marks (Bubeck et al., 2023), the idea of using LLMs as knowledge bases still has two fundamen- tal limitations. First, LLMs are not able to answer questions about events that have happened after they were trained. Second, even the largest models struggle to memorise knowledge that is only rarely mentioned in the training corpus (Kandpal et al., 2022; Mallen et al., 2023). The standard solution to these issues is to rely on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) (Lee et al., 2019; Lewis et al., 2020; Guu et al., 2020). Answering a question then essentially involves retrieving relevant pas- sages from a corpus and feeding these passages, along with the original question, to the LM. While initial approaches relied on specialised LMs for retrieval-augmented language modelling (Khandel- wal et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022), recent work has suggested that simply adding retrieved docu- ments to the input of a standard LM can also work well (Khattab et al., 2022; Ram et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2023), thus making it possible to use retrieval- augmented strategies in combination with LLMs that are only available through APIs. While the usefulness of retrieval-augmented strategies is clear, their implementation requires a significant amount of tuning, as the overall per- formance will be affected by the retrieval model, the considered corpus, the LM, or the prompt for- mulation, among others. Automated evaluation of retrieval-augmented systems is thus paramount. In practice, RAG systems are often evaluated in terms of the language modelling task itself, i.e. by mea- suring perplexity on some reference corpus. How- ever, such evaluations are not always predictive of downstream performance (Wang et al., 2023c). Moreover, this evaluation strategy relies on the LM probabilities, which are not accessible for some closed models (e.g. ChatGPT and GPT-4). Ques- tion answering is another common evaluation task, but usually only datasets with short extractive an- swers are considered, which may not be represen- tative of how the system will be used. To address these issues, in this paper we present RAGAS1, a framework for the automated assess- 1RAGAS available explodinggradients/ragas. is at https://github.com/ ment of retrieval augmented generation systems. We focus on settings where reference answers may not be available, and where we want to estimate different proxies for correctness, in addition to the usefulness of the retrieved passages. The RAGAS framework provides an integration with both llama- index and Langchain, the most widely used frame- works for building RAG solutions, thus enabling developers to easily integrate RAGAS into their standard workflow. 2 Related Work Estimating faithfulness using LLMs The prob- lem of detecting hallucinations in LLM generated responses has been extensively studied (Ji et al., 2023). Several authors have suggested the idea of predicting factuality using a few-shot prompt- ing strategy (Zhang et al., 2023). Recent analy- ses, however, suggest that existing models struggle with detecting hallucination when using standard prompting strategies (Li et al., 2023; Azaria and Mitchell, 2023). Other approaches rely on linking the generated responses to facts from an external knowledge base (Min et al., 2023), but this is not always possible. Yet another strategy is to inspect the probabili- ties assigned to individual tokens, where we would expect the model to be less confident in halluci- nated answers than in factual ones. For instance, BARTScore (Yuan et al., 2021) estimates factuality by looking at the conditional probability of the gen- erated text given the input. Kadavath et al. (2022) use a variation of this idea. Starting from the ob- servation that LLMs provide well-calibrated proba- bilities when answering multiple-choice questions, they essentially convert the problem of validating model generated answers into a multiple-choice question which asks whether the answer is true or false.

Evaluating RAG architectures is, however, chal- lenging because there are several dimensions to consider: the ability of the retrieval system to identify relevant and focused context passages, the ability of the LLM to exploit such passages in a faithful way, or the quality of the gener- ation itself. With RAGAS, we put forward a suite of metrics which can be used to evaluate these different dimensions without having to rely on ground truth human annotations. We posit that such a framework can crucially con- tribute to faster evaluation cycles of RAG archi- tectures, which is especially important given the fast adoption of LLMs. 1 \"\n    ]\n}\nOutput: ", "response": "generations=[[ChatGeneration(text='{\\n    \"query\": \"Can you tell me how RAGAS, a Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment framework, helps in evaluating RAG pipelines without relying on human annotations?\",\\n    \"answer\": \"RAGAS, or Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment, is a framework used for the reference-free evaluation of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

Uncovering Stereotypes in Large Language Models Zara Siddique∗, Liam D. Turner∗, Luis Espinosa-Anke∗† ∗School of Computer Science and Informatics, Cardiff University, United Kingdom †AMPLYFI, United Kingdom {siddiquezs2,turnerl9,espinosa-ankel}@cardiff.ac.uk Abstract Large language models (LLMs) have been shown to propagate and amplify harmful stereo- types, particularly those that disproportion- ately affect marginalised communities. To un- derstand the effect of these stereotypes more comprehensively, we introduce GlobalBias, a dataset of 876k sentences incorporating 40 dis- tinct gender-by-ethnicity groups alongside de- scriptors typically used in bias literature, which enables us to study a broad set of stereotypes from around the world. We use GlobalBias to directly probe a suite of LMs via perplex- ity, which we use as a proxy to determine how certain stereotypes are represented in the model’s internal representations. Following this, we generate character profiles based on given names and evaluate the prevalence of stereotypes in model outputs. We find that the demographic groups associated with vari- ous stereotypes remain consistent across model likelihoods and model outputs. Furthermore, larger models consistently display higher levels of stereotypical outputs, even when explicitly instructed not to. 1 Introduction LLMs are increasingly used for tasks that span ar- eas of concern for bias and fairness (Anthis et al., 2024), such as user discrimination in recommenda- tions (Xu et al., 2023). Despite the obvious need for ethical frameworks around these models, these are mostly lacking or incomplete, and make research into fairness and bias essential for supporting pub- lic confidence in the use of generative AI. While bias is often defined in ambiguous and conflict- ing ways (Blodgett et al., 2020), in this paper we focus on representational harms, defined by Craw- ford (2017) as harms that “occur when systems reinforce the subordination of some groups along the lines of identity,” specifically harms caused by stereotyping. Existing research on stereotypes in LMs is lim- ited, and predominantly focuses on African Ameri- Attribute Name Age Personality Traits Negative Traits Hobbies Occupation Height Hair Colour Eye Colour Skin Colour Build Socioeconomic Status Sexual Orientation Religion Details Kazuyo 45 Calm, Wise, Observant Perfectionist, Indecisive, Shy Bonsai gardening, Origami, Tea ceremonies Librarian 5.2 ft Black Brown Light Petite Middle class Asexual Shinto Table 1: Example of a character profile generated by Claude 3 Opus for given name Kazuyo (Japanese, F).

Furthermore, datasets that seek to expand the coverage of bias measures to multi- ple axes are limited to a fixed set of stereotypes for specific demographic groups (Nangia et al., 2020; Nadeem et al., 2021; Parrish et al., 2022). To ad- dress these limitations, we focus on incorporating a wide range of ethnicities, allowing us to gain a more international view of the effects of bias. We also highlight the importance of analysis that uses a intersectional lens, where biases compound across a combination of different axes, e.g., gender and ethnicity, to cause unique harms. In Sections 4 and 5, we utilise templates involv- ing stereotypes for 40 groups, defined by both an ethnicity and a gender, e.g. English Female or Chi- nese Female, along with a descriptor (e.g. ’good at math’) to explore which descriptors are more likely to appear in a sentence with certain given names across different LLMs.\",\n        \"<2-hop>\\n\\nConsidering the limitations of using a fixed set of stereotypes and the fact that likelihoods do not always correspond to model outputs (Parrish et al., 2022), in Section 6, we take a lexicon-free ap- proach that utilizes the given names in our dataset in a generation task. An example output can be seen in Table 1. We present both quantitative and qual- itative analyses of representational harms caused by stereotypical outputs. The results highlight the magnitude of stereotypical bias across both open and closed-sourced LLMs. From this, this work presents the following contributions: 1. the GlobalBias1 dataset for studying harm- ful stereotypes, which consists of 876,000 sentences for 40 distinct gender-by-ethnicity groups 2. an analysis of which stereotypes are surfaced for each group by a number of LMs, and the extent and nature of harm caused by the these stereotypes, particularly for intersec- tional groups 3. the finding that larger models have more stereotypical outputs, even when explicitly in- structed to avoid stereotypes and clichés 4. the finding that bias stays consistent across model’s internal representation and outputs, contrary to claims in previous work in the field. 2 Background and Related Work 2.1 Impact of Stereotyping Stereotyping can influence how we perceive our- selves and others, as well as how we behave to- wards others. For example, Bertrand and Mul- lainathan (2004) found résumés with White names received 50% more invitations to interview than resumes with Black names. More broadly, Bier- nat (2003) found that when one judges individual members of stereotyped groups on stereotyped di- mensions, one does so with reference to within- category standards, e.g. evaluations of men and women on leadership competence may not be di- rectly comparable, as their meaning is tied to differ- ent referents: ‘good’ for a woman does not mean 1The dataset and code used to evaluate the mod- els can be found at https://github.com/groovychoons/ GlobalBias. the same thing as ‘good’ for a man. LLMs trained on data that includes stereotypes or LLMs using non-comprehensive systems to mitigate biases can perpetuate discrimination and social inequality in ways that are difficult to detect and address. 2.2 Axes of Analysis Early work on bias in word embeddings focused on a single dimension, predominantly binary gen- der (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2018b; Ethayarajh et al., 2019), and less frequently, race (Caliskan et al., 2017; Garg et al., 2018). Work looking at a single demographic axis often fails to mirror the reality of race and gender being inter- twined. Crenshaw (1989) defines how using a single-axis framework erases Black women’s experience in le- gal and political contexts, as race discrimination tends to be viewed in terms of gender-privileged Blacks, and gender discrimination focuses on race- privileged women. Crenshaw provides a frame- work for understanding how different aspects of a person’s social and political identities combine to create different modes of discrimination and privi- lege, known as intersectionality. There is a growing body of research in the field of intersectional bias, which starts to investigate the nuance of how race and gender interact (Jiang and Fellbaum, 2020). There are several measures defined for evaluating intersectional biases, such as the angry black woman stereotype in contextual word embeddings (May et al., 2019; Tan and Celis, 2019), the contextual word embedding test (CEAT) which also looks at a limited and fixed labelled set of stereotypes (Guo and Caliskan, 2020), and others (Lepori, 2020; Cao et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2023). 2.3 Stereotype Datasets This paper builds on previous work using stereo- types as a means of exploring characteristics that are observed to be associated with specific demo- graphic groups, reinforcing established social hi- erarchies (Greenwald et al., 1998; Blodgett et al., 2021). A number of datasets have been developed to look specifically at stereotypes, largely focus- ing on using sentence pairs to compare two de- mographic groups (May et al., 2019), a stereotype and anti-stereotype (Zhao et al., 2018a; Nangia et al., 2020; Nadeem et al., 2021), or a question and answer set to compare two groups (Parrish et al., 2022). While valuable, these datasets are all situ- ated within a U.S. context (Blodgett et al., 2021), and are unsuitable for our context of analysing mul- tiple subgroups across a single stereotype. In con- trast, our one-vs-all approach offers more robust statistical power, and reduces the impact of outliers and natural variability in two-group comparisons. In terms of metrics, we posit that perplexity, which Smith et al. (2022) and Smith and Williams (2021) used to compare multiple subgroups in one test, is a suitable method, and thus we develop it further. 2.4 Use of Proper Names There exists measurable statistical tendencies for names to refer to both gender and race demo- graphics (Tzioumis, 2018). May et al. (2019) ob- serves that \\\"tests based on given names more of- ten find a significant association than those based on group terms\\\". Therefore, we use given names as a proxy for ethnicity and gender, based on ev- idence that given names are often used to draw stereotypical conclusions about people by both hu- mans (Bertrand and Mullainathan, 2003; Dechief and Oreopoulos, 2012) and in LLM outputs (De- Arteaga et al., 2019; Romanov et al., 2019; Maud- slay et al., 2019). Using a range of names for each group intends to mitigate the impact of any single name on the group’s overall results. 3 The Dataset We propose a new dataset named GlobalBias for studying harmful stereotypes, which consists of sets of 10 proper names spanning 40 groups. A summary of key data can be found in Table 2. 3.1 Proper Names Our primary objective is to compile a list of di- verse demographic groups, alongside representa- tive names for each group. In this section, we discuss how we build such a dataset, of specifically 40 distinct groups, starting from existing labeled resources. Our seed dataset of names is the Genni + Eth- nea dataset (Torvik, 2018). It contains over 2 mil- lion names, each annotated with ethnicity and gen-\"\n    ]\n}\nOutput: ", "response": "generations=[[ChatGeneration(text='{\\n    \"query\": \"How does the GlobalBias dataset, which includes 876,000 sentences for 40 distinct gender-by-ethnicity groups, address limitations in existing stereotype datasets?\",\\n    \"answer\": \"The GlobalBias dataset addresses limitations in existing stereotype datasets by incorporating a wide range of ethnicities, allowing for a more international view of the effects of bias.
